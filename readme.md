Repo with several Feature Distillation implementations.
Results in Results.ipynb
For experiments with Cifar10 use KD_distillation.py or feat_distillation.py. For experiments with imageNet use imagenet_KD.py or imagenet_feats.py (KD means distillation using only logits and feats using logits and features). 

All important code is in folder lib. Cifar-10 models are in lib/models, imagenet models are downloaded directly from the API.
